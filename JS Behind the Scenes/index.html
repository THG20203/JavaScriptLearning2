    <h1>JS Behind the Scenes</h1>
    <h2>High level overview JS</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript = high level, object orientated, multi paradigm programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      But also - protoype based, interpreted/ just-in-time compiled, dynamic,
      single-threaded, garbage collected programming languages, with first-class
      functions and non-blocking event loop concurrency model.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>High-level</strong> - don't have to manage resources -
        everything happens automatically.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Garbage-collected</strong> - cleaning memory for us</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interpreted or just-in-time compiled</strong> - computers
        processor only understands 0's, 1's. JavaScript is humen readable -
        abstraction of machine code - that step is compiling / interpreting in
        JavaScript engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multi paradigm</strong> - paradigm is an approach / mindset of
        structuring code. JavaScript multi paradigm (flexible) - procedural,
        object orientated, functional programming. imperitive / declarative.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prototype-based object-orientated</strong> - JavaScript ->
        almost everything is an object, except primitive values like numbers,
        strings. arrays for example are just objects. Protoype inheritence.
        Create arrays from array blueprint (template), called a prototype. This
        contains all the array methods. The arrays that we create in our code
        then inherit the methods from the blue print (so we can use them on the
        arrays).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>First-class functions</strong> - means functions = variables.
        Can pass them into other functions, return functions from functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic</strong> - no data type definitions. Types becomes known
        at runtime. Data type of varialbe is automatically changed. let x =
        23;<br />
        x= "Jonas";
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Single-threaded</strong> - Concuerrancy model = how JavaScript
        handles multiple tasks happening at the same time. Why do we need that?
        JavaScript runs in one single threat, so it can only do one thing at a
        time. Thread = set of instructions executed in CPU.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-blocking event loop</strong> - What about a long running
        task? Sounds like it would block the single thread. But, we want non
        blocking behavior. How do we achieve that? Event loop - event loop:
        takes long running tasks, executes them in the background, puts them
        back in main thread once they are finished.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JavaScript engine and runtime</h2>
    <p>JS Engine - executes JavaScript code</p>
    <p>Any JS Engine has call stack and heap</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Execution Context = Where code is executed</li>
      <li>
        Heap = unstructured memory pool which stores all objects our application
        needs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Compilation vs. interpretation</p>
    <p>
      Compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, and
      written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interpretation: Interpreter runs through the source code and executes it
      line by line. Code still needs to be converted to machine code before
      executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just-in-time (JIT) compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code
      at once, then executed immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parsing code (read code) -> Parsing process - code is parsed into a data
      structure called AST. Optimisation is happening too.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript runtime - container including all the things that we need to
      use JavaScript (in this case the browser). Core part of runtime is JS
      Engine. Also need Web API's (DOM, console.log etc). JavaScript gets access
      to Web Api's (THAT AREN'T PART OF JS) through the global window object.
      Callback queue - data structure - contains all callback functions ready to
      be excuted. Event Loop - essential for non-blocking concurrency model.
    </p>
