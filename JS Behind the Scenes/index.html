    <h1>JS Behind the Scenes</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript = high level, object orientated, multi paradigm programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      But also - protoype based, interpreted/ just-in-time compiled, dynamic,
      single-threaded, garbage collected programming languages, with first-class
      functions and non-blocking event loop concurrency model.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>High-level</strong> - don't have to manage resources -
        everything happens automatically.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Garbage-collected</strong> - cleaning memory for us</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interpreted or just-in-time compiled</strong> - computers
        processor only understands 0's, 1's. JavaScript is humen readable -
        abstraction of machine code - that step is compiling / interpreting in
        JavaScript engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multi paradigm</strong> - paradigm is an approach / mindset of
        structuring code. JavaScript multi paradigm (flexible) - procedural,
        object orientated, functional programming. imperitive / declarative.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prototype-based object-orientated</strong> - JavaScript ->
        almost everything is an object, except primitive values like numbers,
        strings. arrays for example are just objects. Protoype inheritence.
        Create arrays from array blueprint (template), called a prototype. This
        contains all the array methods. The arrays that we create in our code
        then inherit the methods from the blue print (so we can use them on the
        arrays).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>First-class functions</strong> - means functions = variables.
        Can pass them into other functions, return functions from functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic</strong> - no data type definitions. Types becomes known
        at runtime. Data type of varialbe is automatically changed. let x =
        23;<br />
        x= "Jonas";
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Single-threaded</strong> - Concuerrancy model = how JavaScript
        handles multiple tasks happening at the same time. Why do we need that?
        JavaScript runs in one single threat, so it can only do one thing at a
        time. Thread = set of instructions executed in CPU.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-blocking event loop</strong> - What about a long running
        task? Sounds like it would block the single thread. But, we want non
        blocking behavior. How do we achieve that? Event loop - event loop:
        takes long running tasks, executes them in the background, puts them
        back in main thread once they are finished.
      </li>
