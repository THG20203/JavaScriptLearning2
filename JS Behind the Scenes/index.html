    <h1>JS Behind the Scenes</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript = high level, object orientated, multi paradigm programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      But also - protoype based, interpreted/ just-in-time compiled, dynamic,
      single-threaded, garbage collected programming languages, with first-class
      functions and non-blocking event loop concurrency model.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        High-level - don't have to manage resources - everything happens
        automatically.
      </li>
      <li>Garbage-collected - cleaning memory for us</li>
      <li>
        Interpreted or just-in-time compiled - computers processor only
        understands 0's, 1's. JavaScript is humen readable - abstraction of
        machine code - that step is compiling / interpreting in JavaScript
        engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multi paradigm - paradigm is an approach / mindset of structuring code.
        JavaScript multi paradigm (flexible) - procedural, object orientated,
        functional programming. imperitive / declarative.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prototype-based object-orientated - JavaScript -> almost everything is
        an object, except primitive values like numbers, strings. arrays for
        example are just objects. Protoype inheritence. Create arrays from array
        blueprint (template), called a prototype. This contains all the array
        methods. The arrays that we create in our code then inherit the methods
        from the blue print (so we can use them on the arrays).
      </li>
      <li>
        First-class functions - means functions = variables. Can pass them into
        other functions, return functions from functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dynamic - no data type definitions. Types becomes known at runtime. Data
        type of varialbe is automatically changed. let x = 23;<br />
        x= "Jonas";
      </li>
      <li>Single-threaded</li>
      <li>Non-blocking event loop</li>
    </ul>
